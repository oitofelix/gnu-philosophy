@item PO4A can't recognize Texinfo 5.2 quotation-like environments
In PO4A 0.45 the quotation-like Texinfo environments
@code{smallquotation}, @code{indentedblock}, @code{smallindentedblock}
and @code{raggedright}, present in Texinfo 5.2, are not registered in
its Texinfo module, causing @command{po4a-gettextize} to yield errors
like:

@example
master.texi:71: (po4a::tex) unmatched end of environment
@end example

when such environments are found in master documents.  The fix is
already applied in their @abbr{VCS, Version Control System}
repository.  You can obtain the required development version running:

@example
svn checkout svn://scm.alioth.debian.org/svn/po4a/trunk
@end example

For the specific patch, check:
@url{https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/po4a-devel/2014-January/002240.html,
[Po4a-devel] [PATCH] Register missing Texinfo 5.2 quotation-like
environments}.


@item ImageMagick program @command{convert} treatment of BDF and TTF fonts
There is a bug in ImageMagick program @command{convert}, which is used
to perform the rendering of several language scripts, that prevents
@abbr{BDF, Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format} and @abbr{PCF, Portable
Compiled Format} formats of GNU Unifont from working properly.  If you
see messages like @samp{convert: geometry does not contain image}
probably you are experiencing that bug.  The @abbr{TTF, TrueType}
format of GNU Unifont is known to work properly.  Therefore, to fix
such a bug download the TTF build of GNU Unifont from
@url{http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont-6.3.20131020/font-builds/unifont-6.3.20131020.ttf.gz}
and ask the GNU philosophy build system to use it by means of the
@command{configure} option @option{--with-font}.
