This particular text can be seen by running @samp{make help-clean}.
@end smallindentedblock
@end ifclear

Sometimes, after the building process (see @inlineifclear{help,
@ref{Build}}@inlineifset{help, @samp{help-build}}), it is useful to
delete all file objects built by @command{make} invocation which are
present in the build tree, perhaps because it coincides with the
source tree and you want to make it like pristine again, or you want
to ensure every object gets rebuilt after a particular change to the
sources or build procedure.  The primary used for this is
@samp{all-clean[@var{a}][@var{f}][@var{l}]}.  Therefore, to clean all
collection and standalone formats, in all available languages, invoke
@samp{make all-clean}.  As explained in @inlineifclear{help, @ref{Goal
suffixes}}@inlineifset{help, @samp{help-suffixes}}, you can further
specify the cleaning by using any combination of @emph{aggregate},
@emph{format} and @emph{language} suffixes.
