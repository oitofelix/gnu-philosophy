This particular text can be seen by running @samp{make help-install}.
@end smallindentedblock
@end ifclear

After the building process (see @inlineifclear{help,
@ref{Build}}@inlineifset{help, @samp{help-build}}), comes the last
step: the installation of the package.  The primary used for this is
@samp{all-install[@var{a}][@var{f}][@var{l}]}.  Therefore, to install
all collection and standalone formats, in all available languages,
invoke @samp{make all-install}.  As explained in @inlineifclear{help,
@ref{Goal suffixes}}@inlineifset{help, @samp{help-suffixes}}, you can
further specify the installation by using any combination of
@emph{aggregate}, @emph{format} and @emph{language} suffixes.  Notice
that invoking the installation of an aggregate type, output format or
translation language not already built will automatically trigger its
build before installation.

The @url{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/, GNU website philosophy
section essays} and the @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/philosophy/,
homepage of GNU philosophy package} cannot be installed, but are
available in the directories (relative to the build top directory)
@file{essays/src/www/www-gnu} and @file{essays/src/www/homepage}.

The installation puts the built essays documents into the directory

@example
@var{docdir}/@var{language}/@var{aggregate}/@var{format}
@end example

where @var{docdir}, @var{language}, @var{aggregate} and @var{format},
are the @emph{documentation directory}, which can be specified with
the script @command{configure} option @option{--docdir} and defaults
to @file{/usr/local/share/doc/philosophy}, the @emph{translation
language}, @samp{en} for the original essays, @emph{aggregate type}
and @emph{output format}.

Naturally, there are a goal to uninstall the package almost analogous
to its installation counterpart:
@samp{all-uninstall[@var{a}][@var{f}][@var{l}]}.  Obviously, it will
not trigger the build and installation before the removal of the
selected set of essays.
