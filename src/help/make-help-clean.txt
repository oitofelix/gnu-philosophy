Build System Help: Cleaning
***************************

   Sometimes, after the building process (see ‘help-build’), it is
useful to delete all file objects built by ‘make’ invocation which are
present in the build tree, perhaps because it coincides with the source
tree and you want to make it like pristine again, or you want to ensure
every object gets rebuilt after a particular change to the sources or
build procedure.  The primary used for this is ‘all-clean[A][F][L]’.
Therefore, to clean all collection and standalone formats, in all
available languages, invoke ‘make all-clean’.  As explained in
‘help-suffixes’, you can further specify the cleaning by using any
combination of _aggregate_, _format_ and _language_ suffixes.
