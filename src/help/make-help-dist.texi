This particular text can be seen by running @samp{make help-dist}.

There are a couple of goals which are specially useful for the package
maintainers: @samp{dist} and @samp{distcheck}.  The former creates a
pristine distribution tarball, and the latter does as the former but
additionally performs a lengthy check on the resultant tarball to
ensure its soundness.  As one would expect, unlike other goals, both
of this goals doesn't accept any suffixes, because there is no sense
in partitioning the distribution tarball.
