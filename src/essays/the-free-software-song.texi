This song is in a rhythm of 7/8; those unaccustomed to odd rhythms
often take the unevenness to be a mistake. The meter can be analyzed
into three subgroups as slow-quick-quick or 3-2-2. Such meters in
Bulgarian music can often be stretched, and some musicians analyze
this song as 3-2-3 instead; however, the last ``3'' is not as long as
the first. Yves Moreau, who collected and taught the dance, endorses
the rhythm of 7.
