<h3 class="heading">Free Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-free-_0028see-also-free-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-free-software-_0028see-also-free-software_002c-four-freedoms_002c-citizen-values_002c-selling_002c-and-software_0029"></a>

<p>Free software is software that comes with permission for anyone to
use, copy, and/or distribute, either verbatim or with modifications,
either gratis or for a fee. In particular, this means that source code
must be available. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not source, it&rsquo;s not software.&rdquo; This is
a simplified description; see also the full definition
(<cite><a href="the-free-software-definition.html#Top">The Free Software Definition</a></cite>).
</p>
<p>If a program is free, then it can potentially be included in a free
operating system such as GNU, or free versions of the GNU/Linux
system.
</p>
<p>There are many different ways to make a program free&mdash;many questions
of detail, which could be decided in more than one way and still make
the program free. Some of the possible variations are described
below. For information on specific free software licenses, see the
license list page, at
<a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.
</p>
<p>Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. But proprietary
software companies typically use the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; to refer
to price. Sometimes they mean that you can obtain a binary copy at no
charge; sometimes they mean that a copy is bundled with a computer
that you are buying, and the price includes both. Either way, it has
nothing to do with what we mean by free software in the GNU Project.
</p>
<p>Because of this potential confusion, when a software company says its
product is free software, always check the actual distribution terms
to see whether users really have all the freedoms that free software
implies. Sometimes it really is free software; sometimes it isn&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>Many languages have two separate words for &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in freedom and
&ldquo;free&rdquo; as in zero price. For example, French has &ldquo;libre&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gratuit.&rdquo; Not so English; there is a word &ldquo;gratis&rdquo; that refers
unambiguously to price, but no common adjective that refers
unambiguously to freedom. So if you are speaking another language, we
suggest you translate &ldquo;free&rdquo; into your language to make it
clearer. See our list of translations of the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo;
into various other languages
(<cite><a href="translations-of-the-term-free-software.html#Top">Translations of the Term &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo;</a></cite>).
</p>
<p>Free software is often more reliable than nonfree software.

<a name="index-open-source-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>

<p>The term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; software is used by some people to mean more
or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same
class of software: they accept some licenses that we consider too
restrictive, and there are free software licenses they have not
accepted. However, the differences in extension of the category are
small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open
source software is free.
<a name="index-free-software_002c-essential-difference-between-open-source-and"></a>
<a name="index-open-source_002c-essential-difference-between-free-software-and"></a>
</p>
<p>We prefer the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; because it refers to
freedom&mdash;something that the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; does not do.
</p>



&#12;
<a name="Public-Domain-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">Public Domain Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-public-domain-_0028see-also-public-domain-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-public-domain-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-copyright_002c-public-domain-software-and-_0028see-also-public-domain-software_0029"></a>

<p>Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. If the
source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of
noncopylefted free software, which means that some copies or modified
versions may not be free at all.
</p>
<p>In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain but
the source code is not available. This is not free software, because
free software requires accessibility of source code.  Meanwhile, most
free software is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted, and the
copyright holders have legally given permission for everyone to use it
in freedom, using a free software license.
</p>
<p>Sometimes people use the term &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; in a loose fashion to
mean &ldquo;free&rdquo; or &ldquo;available gratis.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; is a
legal term and means, precisely, &ldquo;not copyrighted.&rdquo; For clarity, we
recommend using &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; for that meaning only, and using
other terms to convey the other meanings.
</p>
<p>Under the
<a name="index-copyright_002c-Berne-Convention"></a>
<a name="index-Berne-Convention-_0028see-also-copyright_0029"></a>
Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything written
down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs. Therefore,
if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain, you
must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it; otherwise,
the program is copyrighted.

<a name="Copylefted-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">Copylefted Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-copylefted-_0028see-also-copylefted-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-copylefted-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>

<p>Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms ensure
that all copies of all versions carry more or less the same
distribution terms. This means, for instance, that copyleft licenses
generally disallow others to add additional requirements to the
software (though a limited set of safe added requirements can be
allowed) and require making source code available. This shields the
program, and its modified versions, from some of the common ways of
making a program proprietary.
</p>
<p>Some copyleft licenses, such as GPL version&nbsp;3, block other
means of turning software proprietary, such as tivoization.
</p>
<p>In the GNU Project, we copyleft almost all the software we write,
because our goal is to give <em>every</em> user the freedoms implied by
the term &ldquo;free software.&rdquo; See the essay <cite><a href="what-is-copyleft.html#Top">What Is Copyleft?</a></cite> for more explanation of how
copyleft works and why we use it.
</p>
<a name="index-copyleft_002c-and-GPL"></a>

<p>Copyleft is a general concept; to copyleft an actual program,
you need to use a specific set of distribution terms. There are many
possible ways to write copyleft distribution terms, so in principle
there can be many copyleft free software licenses. However, in actual
practice nearly all copylefted software uses the GNU General Public
License. Two different copyleft licenses are usually &ldquo;incompatible,&rdquo;
which means it is illegal to merge the code using one license with the
code using the other license; therefore, it is good for the community
if people use a single copyleft license.
</p>

<a name="Noncopylefted-Free-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">Noncopylefted Free Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-noncopylefted-free-_0028see-also-noncopylefted-free-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-noncopylefted-free-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<p>Noncopylefted free software comes from the author with permission to
redistribute and modify, and also to add additional restrictions to
it.
</p>
<p>If a program is free but not copylefted, then some copies or modified
versions may not be free at all. A software company can compile the
program, with or without modifications, and distribute the executable
file as a proprietary software product.
</p>
<a name="index-X-Window-System"></a>
<a name="index-X-Consortium-_0028see-also-Open-Group_002c-its-successor_0029"></a>
<a name="index-X11-licenses-1"></a>
<p>The X Window System illustrates this. The X Consortium releases X11
with distribution terms that make it noncopylefted free software. If
you wish, you can get a copy which has those distribution terms and is
free. However, there are nonfree versions as well, and there are (or
at least were) popular workstations and PC graphics boards for which
nonfree versions are the only ones that work. If you are using this
hardware, X11 is not free software for you. The developers of X11 even
made X11 nonfree for a while; they were able to do this because others
had contributed their code under the same noncopyleft license.

<h3 class="heading">Lax Permissive Licensed Software</h3>

<a name="index-lax-permissive-licensed-software"></a>
<a name="index-software_002c-lax-permissive-licensed"></a>
<p>Lax permissive licenses include the
<a name="index-X11-licenses"></a>
X11 license and the two
<a name="index-BSD-licenses-_0028see-also-both-_0060_0060BSD_002dstyle_0027_0027-and-GPL_0029"></a>
BSD licenses. These licenses permit almost any use of the code,
including distributing proprietary binaries with or without changing
the source code.
</p>



&#12;
<a name="GPL_002dCovered-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">GPL-Covered Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-GPL_002dcovered-_0028see-also-GPL_002dcovered-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-GPL_002c-GPL_002dcovered-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-GPL_002dcovered-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<p>The GNU GPL (General Public License) is one specific set of
distribution terms for copylefting a program. The GNU Project uses it
as the distribution terms for most GNU software.
</p>
<p>To equate free software with GPL-covered software is therefore an
error.
</p>

<a name="The-GNU-Operating-System"></a>
<h3 class="heading">The GNU Operating System</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-GNU-operating-system-_0028see-also-GNU_0029"></a>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-operating-system-_0028see-also-both-software-and-GNU_0029"></a>

<p>The GNU operating system is the Unix-like operating system, which is
entirely free software, that we in the GNU Project have developed
since 1984.
</p>
<a name="index-TeX"></a>
<p>A Unix-like operating system consists of many programs. The GNU system
includes all the GNU software, as well as many other packages, such as
the X Window System and TeX, which are not GNU software.
</p>
<a name="index-Hurd_002c-GNU"></a>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-Hurd"></a>
<a name="index-kernel_002c-GNU-Hurd"></a>
<p>The first test release of the complete GNU system was in 1996. This
includes the GNU Hurd, our kernel, developed since 1990. In 2001 the
GNU system (including the GNU Hurd) began working fairly reliably, but
the Hurd still lacks some important features, so it is not widely
used. Meanwhile, the GNU/Linux system, an offshoot of the GNU
operating system which uses Linux as the kernel instead of the GNU
Hurd, has been a great success since the 90s.
</p>
<p>Since the purpose of GNU is to be free, every single component in the
GNU operating system has to be free software. They don&rsquo;t all have to
be copylefted, however; any kind of free software is legally suitable
to include if it helps meet technical goals. And it isn&rsquo;t necessary
for all the components to be GNU software, individually. GNU can and
does include noncopylefted free software such as the X Window System
that were developed by other projects.
</p>

<a name="GNU-Programs"></a>
<h3 class="heading">GNU Programs</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-GNU-programs-_0028see-also-GNU-programs_0029"></a>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-programs-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>

<p>&ldquo;GNU programs&rdquo; is equivalent to GNU software. A program Foo is a GNU
program if it is GNU software. We also sometimes say it is a &ldquo;GNU
package.&rdquo;
</p>



&#12;
<a name="GNU-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">GNU Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-GNU_0028see-also-GNU-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-GNU-_0028see-also-both-software-and-GNU_0029"></a>
<p>GNU software is software that is released under the auspices of the
GNU Project. If a program is GNU software, we also say that it is a
GNU program or a GNU package. The README or manual of a GNU package
should say it is one; also, the Free Software Directory identifies all
GNU packages.
</p>
<p>Most GNU software is copylefted, but not all; however, all GNU
software must be free software.
</p>
<a name="index-FSF_002c-software-development"></a>
<a name="index-FSF_002c-copyright-on-software"></a>
<p>Some GNU software was written by staff of the Free Software
Foundation, but most GNU software comes from many volunteers. (Some of
these volunteers are paid by companies or universities, but they are
volunteers for us.) Some contributed software is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation; some is copyrighted by the contributors who
wrote it.

<h3 class="heading">Nonfree Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-nonfree-_0028see-also-nonfree-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-nonfree-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<p>Nonfree software is any software that is not free.  Its use,
redistribution or modification is prohibited, or requires you to ask
for permission, or is restricted so much that you effectively can&rsquo;t do
it freely.
</p>



&#12;
<a name="Proprietary-Software"></a>
<h3 class="heading">Proprietary Software</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-proprietary-_0028see-also-proprietary-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-proprietary-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<p>Proprietary software is another name for nonfree software.  In the
past we subdivided nonfree software into &ldquo;semifree software,&rdquo; which
could be modified and redistributed noncommercially, and &ldquo;proprietary
software,&rdquo; which could not be. But we have dropped that distinction
and now use &ldquo;proprietary software&rdquo; as synonymous with nonfree
software.
</p>
<a name="index-FSF_002c-on-installing-proprietary-software"></a>
<p>The Free Software Foundation follows the rule that we cannot install
any proprietary program on our computers except temporarily for the
specific purpose of writing a free replacement for that very
program. Aside from that, we feel there is no possible excuse for
installing a proprietary program.
</p>
<p>For example, we felt justified in installing Unix on our computer in
the 1980s, because we were using it to write a free replacement for
Unix. Nowadays, since free operating systems are available, the excuse
is no longer applicable; we do not use any nonfree operating systems,
and any new computer we install must run a completely free operating
system.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t insist that users of GNU, or contributors to GNU, have to
live by this rule. It is a rule we made for ourselves. But we hope you
will follow it too, for your freedom&rsquo;s sake.

<a name="index-_0060_0060freeware_002c_0027_0027-erroneous-use-of-term"></a>
<p>The term &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; has no clear accepted definition, but it is
commonly used for packages which permit redistribution but not
modification (and their source code is not available). These packages
are <em>not</em> free software, so please don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; to
refer to free software.
</p>

<h3 class="heading">Shareware</h3>

<a name="index-software_002c-shareware"></a>
<a name="index-shareware-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<p>Shareware is software which comes with permission for people to
redistribute copies, but says that anyone who continues to use a copy
is <em>required</em> to pay a license fee.
</p>
<p>Shareware is not free software, or even semifree. There are two
reasons it is not:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For most shareware, source code is not available; thus, you cannot
modify the program at all.

</li><li> Shareware does not come with permission to make a copy and install it
without paying a license fee, not even for individuals engaging in
nonprofit activity. (In practice, people often disregard the
distribution terms and do this anyway, but the terms don&rsquo;t permit it.)

<a name="index-private-software-_0028see-also-software_0029"></a>
<a name="index-development_002c-private-software"></a>
<p>Private or custom software is software developed for one user
(typically an organization or company). That user keeps it and uses
it, and does not release it to the public either as source code or as
binaries.
</p>
<p>A private program is free software in a trivial sense if its sole user
has full rights to it.
</p>
<p>In general we do not believe it is wrong to develop a program and not
release it. There are occasions when a program is so useful that
withholding it from release is treating humanity badly.  However, most
programs are not that important, so not releasing them is not
particularly harmful. Thus, there is no conflict between the
development of private or custom software and the principles of the
free software movement.
</p>
<p>Nearly all employment for programmers is in development of custom
software; therefore most programming jobs are, or could be, done in a
way compatible with the free software movement.

<a name="index-proprietary-software_002c-to-be-distinguished-from-commercial-software"></a>
<a name="index-development_002c-commercial-software"></a>
<p>Commercial software is software being developed by a business which
aims to make money from the use of the software. &ldquo;Commercial&rdquo; and
&ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; are not the same thing! Most commercial software is
proprietary, but there is commercial free software, and there is
noncommercial nonfree software.
</p>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-Ada-compiler"></a>
<a name="index-Ada-compiler_002c-GNU"></a>
<p>For example, GNU Ada is developed by a company. It is always
distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, and every copy is free
software; but its developers sell support contracts. When their
salesmen speak to prospective customers, sometimes the customers say,
&ldquo;We would feel safer with a commercial compiler.&rdquo; The salesmen
reply, &ldquo;GNU Ada <em>is</em> a commercial compiler; it happens to be
free software.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>For the GNU Project, the emphasis is in the other order: the important
thing is that GNU Ada is free software; whether it is commercial is
just a detail. However, the additional development of GNU Ada that
results from its being commercial is definitely beneficial.
</p>
<p>Please help spread the awareness that free commercial software is
possible. You can do this by making an effort not to say
&ldquo;commercial&rdquo; when you mean &ldquo;proprietary.&rdquo;
