The Free Software Song
**********************

This song is in a rhythm of 7/8; those unaccustomed to odd rhythms often
take the unevenness to be a mistake.  The meter can be analyzed into
three subgroups as slow-quick-quick or 3-2-2.  Such meters in Bulgarian
music can often be stretched, and some musicians analyze this song as
3-2-3 instead; however, the last "3" is not as long as the first.  Yves
Moreau, who collected and taught the dance, endorses the rhythm of 7.
Richard Stallman wrote the lyrics in 1991.

           Hoarders can get piles of money,
           That is true, hackers, that is true.
           But they cannot help their neighbors;
           That's not good, hackers, that's not good.
           
           When we have enough free software
           At our call, hackers, at our call,
           We'll kick out those dirty licenses
           Ever more, hackers, ever more.
