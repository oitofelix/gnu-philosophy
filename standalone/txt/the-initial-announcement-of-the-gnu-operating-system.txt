The Initial Announcement of the GNU Operating System
****************************************************

This is the original announcement of the GNU Project, posted by Richard
Stallman on 27 September 1983.  The actual history of the GNU Project
differs in many ways from this initial plan.  For example, the beginning
was delayed until January 1984.  Several of the philosophical concepts
of free software were not clarified until a few years later.

This document is part of GNU philosophy, the GNU Project's exhaustive
collection of articles and essays about free software and related
matters.

Free Unix!
----------

Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete
Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and
give it away free(1) to everyone who can use it.  Contributions of time,
money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.

   To begin with, GNU will be a kernel plus all the utilities needed to
write and run C programs: editor, shell, C compiler, linker, assembler,
and a few other things.  After this we will add a text formatter, a
YACC, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things.  We
hope to supply, eventually, everything useful that normally comes with a
Unix system, and anything else useful, including on-line and hardcopy
documentation.

   GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to
Unix.  We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our
experience with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have
longer filenames, file version numbers, a crashproof file system,
filename completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and
eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp
programs and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp
will be available as system programming languages.  We will have network
software based on MIT's chaosnet protocol, far superior to UUCP. We may
also have something compatible with UUCP.

Who Am I?
---------

I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original much-imitated EMACS
editor, now at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. I have worked
extensively on compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters, the
Incompatible Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating system.
I pioneered terminal-independent display support in ITS. In addition I
have implemented one crashproof file system and two window systems for
Lisp machines.

Why I Must Write GNU
--------------------

I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must
share it with other people who like it.  I cannot in good conscience
sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement.

   So that I can continue to use computers without violating my
principles, I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free
software so that I will be able to get along without any software that
is not free.

How You Can Contribute
----------------------

I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and money.
I'm asking individuals for donations of programs and work.

   One computer manufacturer has already offered to provide a machine.
But we could use more.  One consequence you can expect if you donate
machines is that GNU will run on them at an early date.  The machine had
better be able to operate in a residential area, and not require
sophisticated cooling or power.

   Individual programmers can contribute by writing a compatible
duplicate of some Unix utility and giving it to me.  For most projects,
such part-time distributed work would be very hard to coordinate; the
independently-written parts would not work together.  But for the
particular task of replacing Unix, this problem is absent.  Most
interface specifications are fixed by Unix compatibility.  If each
contribution works with the rest of Unix, it will probably work with the
rest of GNU.

   If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full
or part time.  The salary won't be high, but I'm looking for people for
whom knowing they are helping humanity is as important as money.  I view
this as a way of enabling dedicated people to devote their full energies
to working on GNU by sparing them the need to make a living in another
way.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The wording here was careless.  The intention was that nobody
would have to pay for _permission_ to use the GNU system.  But the words
don't make this clear, and people often interpret them as saying that
copies of GNU should always be distributed at little or no charge.  That
was never the intent.
