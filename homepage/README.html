<h2 class="majorheading">Description</h2>

<p>GNU philosophy is the GNU Project&rsquo;s exhaustive collection of articles
and essays about free software and related matters.  It provides all
of them <em>standalone</em> or <em>collected</em> as a huge single book,
in <em>Info</em>, <em>HTML</em>, <em>PDF</em>, <em>plain text</em>, and every
other format supported by Texinfo, in several different languages.  It
makes the individual Texinfo source code of any essay readily
available for inclusion in another package&rsquo;s documentation and also
implements a way to generate the whole
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">GNU website philosophy section</a>
automatically from the Texinfo sources.  Last, but not least, it
facilitates the future work of the <acronym title="Free Software
Foundation">FSF</acronym> (Free Software
Foundation) in the publication of free software articles collection
books, like: &ldquo;Free Software, Free Society: Selected Essays of Richard
M. Stallman&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Some highlighted benefits are:
</p><ul>
<li> It is more easy to spread GNU philosophy.  The availability of several
formats means that it is simpler for people to find the desired
article in a file format that fits their constraints and suits the
access, redistribution and presentation requirements.
</li><li> Besides its free software components, the GNU system ought to document
its own philosophy.  It is very natural for users to expect that the
philosophy and history that inspired the GNU system existence be
easily accessible within its documentation system.
</li><li> It makes life easier for authors who want to use their package
documentation to spread the GNU philosophy.  Before it there was no
easy way to get GNU philosophical articles in an adequate format to
include in arbitrary documentation; many articles only existed in HTML
specifically tailored for GNU website, others only in plain text
format hidden deeply inside package distributions, and a bunch in
non-portable Texinfo extensively written for exclusive TeX processing.
</li><li> All essays and articles are written in the GNU Project&rsquo;s standard,
official and hub format: Texinfo.  Making the GNU philosophical
documents comply with GNU standards assists in uniformity and
coherence.  For instance, until this package conception it was
remarkable the almost complete lack of essays in Info, the GNU
Project&rsquo;s official online documentation format.
</li><li> There is a single place of maintenance for GNU Project&rsquo;s philosophical
articles and essays.  The upkeep of all GNU Project&rsquo;s philosophy
documents is optimized since no error must be corrected twice and
every addition is atomically, and instantaneously, available in every
supported format, for every intended purpose.
</li></ul>

<p>The maintainers set a clear commitment to not blindly take for granted
the quality of automatic generated output, and therefore they adapt
the Texinfo source code for the particularities of each available
output format, in order to make it look better, but without the
unmindful and excessive use of back-end specific code.

<a name="Download"></a><a name="Download-1"></a>
<h2 class="majorheading">Download</h2>

<p><strong>The current stable release is 0.1.20140214</strong> (released
February 14, 2014).
</p>
<p>Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/philosophy/philosophy-0.1.20140214.tar.gz
https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/philosophy/philosophy-0.1.20140214.tar.gz.sig
</pre></div>

<p>Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy-0.1.20140214.tar.gz
http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy-0.1.20140214.tar.gz.sig
</pre></div>

<p>You can find that and earlier releases at a nearby
<a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/philosophy/">GNU&nbsp;ftp&nbsp;mirror</a>; or if automatic
redirection does not work use the <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/philosophy/">GNU&nbsp;main&nbsp;ftp&nbsp;server</a>.
</p>
<p>The oldest (non-GNU) releases are available from
<a href="http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/philosophy/">Savannah mirror download area</a>
(alternatively <a href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/philosophy/">Savannah download area</a>).  They
are only of historical interest and are no longer supported.
</p>
<p>Use a <samp>.sig</samp> file to verify that the corresponding file (without
the <samp>.sig</samp> suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both
the <samp>.sig</samp> file and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a
command like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">gpg --verify philosophy-0.1.20140214.tar.gz.sig
</pre></div>

<p>If that command fails because you don&rsquo;t have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">gpg --recv-keys 0x28D618AF --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
</pre></div>

<p>and rerun the &lsquo;<samp>gpg --verify</samp>&rsquo; command.
</p>
<p>This release is signed by <em>Bruno FÃ©lix Rezende Ribeiro</em>.  His key fingerprint
is &lsquo;<samp>7CB1 208C 7336 56B7 5962  2500 27B9 C6FD 28D6 18AF</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Check the key&rsquo;s authenticity with the command
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">gpg --fingerprint 0x28D618AF | sed -n '/^[[:blank:]]\+Key/s/^.*= //p'
</pre></div>

<p>It must print the following fingerprint:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">7CB1 208C 7336 56B7 5962  2500 27B9 C6FD 28D6 18AF
</pre></div>

<p>Otherwise something is wrong!  In that case don&rsquo;t use the downloaded
tarball and contact the developers as described in <a href="#Contact">Contact</a>.
</p>
<p>A CVS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  To stay up to date with the latest developments in the
source tree, you can anonymously checkout the repository with the
following command:

<p>The development sources are available through CVS at Savannah:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display">https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=philosophy
</pre></div>

<p>If you are getting the sources from CVS (or change
<samp>configure.ac</samp>), you&rsquo;ll need to have GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake
and GNU Texinfo installed to (re)build.  All of these programs are
available from <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/">https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/</a>.  Their required minimal versions
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU Autoconf 2.60
</li><li> GNU Automake 1.13
</li><li> GNU Texinfo 5.0
</li></ul>

<p>This release was bootstrapped with the following versions:
</p><ul>
<li> GNU Autoconf 2.69
</li><li> GNU Automake 1.14.1
</li><li> GNU Texinfo 5.2
</li></ul>

<p>After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can
run, in the top-level directory of the source tree, &lsquo;<samp>./bootstrap</samp>&rsquo;
and then &lsquo;<samp><var>srcdir</var>/configure</samp>&rsquo; to do a fresh build.  After
that first time, running <code>make</code> should suffice.  See file
<samp>INSTALL</samp>.
